# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

This project represents an agario client that connects to an agario server
and displays food and players, the player can move around using their mouse and use the
spacebar to split We are expecting to take about 15 - 17 hours on this project

#Branching

Most of this project was done using pair programming but the zoomed branch was made to go work on the 
zooming in on the player while one of us could continue work on implementing other items on the main branch

# Partnership

Mason worked on the bulk of the GUI and having message handling by the client i.e drawing of food and players
9 to 10 hours
Dhruv created the model entirley and fully implemented the zoom feature of GUI 
7 to 8 hours
Lots of pair programming was done and 
we still ended up helping each other with each part they coded lots of this time was overlap.

# Testing
 
We didn't have any unit tests but again wrote the many edge cases we could think of and also wrote the features and
functionality we expected and then basically fully hand tested the project.



# Time Expenditures:

16 Hours 
We are getting much better at projecting our time and overall
our programming skills ahve improved alot
