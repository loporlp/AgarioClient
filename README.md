# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

This project represents an agario client that connects to an agario server
and displays food and players, the player can move around using their mouse and use the
spacebar to split


Most of this project was done using pair programming but the zoomed branch was made to go work on the 
zooming in on the player while one of us could continue work on implementing other items on the main branch
